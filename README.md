# Spam-Email-Classifier

This project is a spam email classifier that uses various machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam. The dataset consists of email content represented as word frequencies, and the target variable indicates whether an email is spam (1) or not (0).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Model Selection and Training
3. Model Evaluation and Comparison
4. Choosing the Best Model

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing email data with word frequencies as features and a binary target variable ("Prediction") indicating whether an email is spam or not. Replace the file path accordingly
